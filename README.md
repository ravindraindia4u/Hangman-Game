                                                            Hangman-Game
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Hangman is a word guessing game, where the player thinks of a word tries to guess it by suggesting letters within a certain number of guesses. 

The word to guess is represented by a row of dashes, representing each letter of the word. If the guessing player suggests a letter which occurs
in the word, then the letter is placed in all its correct positions. If the suggested letter does not occur in the word, the system draws one 
element of a hanged man stick figure as a tally mark.

The player guessing the word may, at any time, attempt to guess the whole word. If the word is correct, the game is over and the guesser wins.
Otherwise, the system may choose to penalize the guesser by adding an element to the diagram. On the other hand, if the player makes enough
incorrect guesses to allow his opponent to complete the diagram, the game is also over, this time with the guesser losing. However,
the guesser can also win by guessing all the letters that appear in the word, thereby completing the word, before the diagram is completed.
